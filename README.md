# daily-mails

A program that displays a message from a randomly chosen Daily Mail (games: The Silver Case, The 25th Ward: The Silver Case)

## Premise

There are these really cool games by Suda51 called "The Silver Case" and "The 25th Ward: The Silver Case" in which one of the main characters (Tokio Morishima) gets a mail with a smart saying daily. So this program just displays one of the possible messages. I wish I could send these to my friends.
